# Mueller-Report-OCR
OCRd version of the redacted Mueller report, to allow easier searching. 

Converted with Adobe Acrobat as "searchable images", it was also minimized (may look crappier) but it had to be under 100mb to fit on github.

I copied and pasted the searchable text. It's pretty bad, but it's something. Kind of busy so I'm not sure if I'll get around to doing another OCR scan before someone else does.
